Calculate confidence intervals price per bed and for price per bathrooms for the city as whole and for the top three neighbourhoods.
Create graphs where possible, that visualises your findings.
Define hypothesis tests for price differences between two neighbourhoods and the different review score between two neighbourhoods
Test unpaired sample means for prices per bed from different neighbourhoods and check if there is a difference in mean or not.
